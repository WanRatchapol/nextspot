# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- **Primary Validation Goal**: Prove that Thai university students will use a simple tool to decide travel destinations faster
- **Speed Validation**: Measure actual decision time reduction from current 30+ minutes baseline
- **User Engagement**: Achieve 50+ weekly active users during 8-week validation period
- **Learning Metrics**: Collect preference data and usage patterns to validate full product hypothesis
- **Technical Proof**: Demonstrate web-first approach can serve student mobile usage patterns

## Background Context
Thai university students in Bangkok spend 30+ minutes deciding where to go for weekend trips, often defaulting to familiar places due to decision paralysis. Rather than building a complex mobile app, this web MVP tests our core hypothesis: *"Thai students will use a simple tool that helps them decide where to go faster, with options that fit their needs."*

This 8-week validation project runs Sept 23 - Nov 25, 2025, targeting Bangkok university students through a mobile-responsive web application focused purely on decision speed validation.
