# Technical Risks & Mitigation

## Key Risks
1. **Mobile Performance**: Web app performance on various devices, especially gesture responsiveness
2. **Content Quality**: Maintaining relevant, accurate destination information with mood categorization
3. **User Discovery**: Getting students to find and try the swiping tool
4. **Gesture Complexity**: Implementing smooth Tinder-style interactions within 8-week timeline

## Mitigation Strategies
1. Extensive mobile testing and gesture library evaluation early in development
2. Start with quality over quantity for destinations, focus on accurate mood tagging
3. University outreach and social media promotion emphasizing unique swiping experience
4. Use proven React gesture libraries rather than building custom solutions
