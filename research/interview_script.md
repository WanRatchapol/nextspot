# 20-Minute Problem Interview Script – Travel Decision App

## 1) Welcome (2 min)
“Hi! Thanks for joining. I’m researching how students in Bangkok decide where to go for short trips or outings. This is not a sales call—I’m here to learn from your experience.”

“Everything you share is confidential and anonymized. May I record audio for note-taking? (yes/no)”

“Please be honest—even small annoyances help. There are no right or wrong answers.”

## 2) Collect Demographics (Confirm ICP fit) (3 min)
Quick, factual—keep it brisk.

- **Age & university/year:** “How old are you and what year are you in? Which campus?”  
- **Location:** “Do you live/study mainly in Bangkok?”  
- **Trip pattern:** “In the last 2–3 months, how many outings or short trips (half-day to 2 days) did you take?”  
- **Typical group & role:** “Who do you usually go with (solo/partner/friends, how many)? Who usually makes the final decision?”  
- **Budget band (per outing):** “Roughly how much do you spend each time? (<฿500 / ฿500–1,000 / ฿1,000–2,000 / >฿2,000)”  
- **Transport mix:** “Mostly BTS/MRT, Grab/taxi, motorbike, walking, or mix?”  
- **Devices & inspiration:** “iOS or Android? Where do you usually get ideas—IG Reels, TikTok, YouTube, blogs, FB groups, friends?”  
- **Privacy comfort:** “Are you okay sharing location with apps while using the app? What about always-on tracking?”  

## 3) Tell a Story (Context & recent experience) (4 min)
Prompt one rich, recent story. Use probes. No pitching.

“Think about the last time you tried to decide where to go in Bangkok (or a nearby trip).  
Walk me through it step by step—from the moment you thought ‘let’s go somewhere’ to when you finally chose (or gave up).”  

**Probes:** “Where did you look first?” “Which apps/sites did you open?” “How long did it take?”  
“What made you confident—or not?” “Who else was involved and how did you coordinate?”  
“What was the final outcome? How satisfied were you (1–5) and why?”  

“Can you recall a time you gave up or defaulted to the same place because deciding was too hard? What happened?”  
“And a time you discovered a great new place—how did that happen and why did it work better?”  

## 4) Problem Ranking (5 min)
Introduce hypotheses neutrally; let them add their own. Rank, then dig into the top one.

“People mention different pain points. From your experience, please rank these from biggest (1) to smallest (4):  
A) I can’t decide—too many options, not personalized.  
B) I have to switch between many platforms to piece info together.  
C) Planning logistics (time, route, cost) is stressful and slow.  
D) Something else (you tell me).”  

“Why is your #1 the top problem? Can you give a recent example?”  

**Severity & frequency:**  
- “On a 1–5 scale, how painful is #1 when it happens?”  
- “How often does it happen (per month or per semester)?”  

**Current workarounds & spend:**  
- “What do you do today to handle it?”  
- “How long does it usually take?” “Any money spent (e.g., paid lists, creators, tools)?”  

**Satisfaction with alternatives:**  
- “What have you tried that almost solves it? What’s missing?”  

## 5) Explore Worldview (Open-ended workflow) (5 min)
Understand their mental model; don’t propose features—ask outcomes.

- **Triggers & constraints:** “What usually triggers you to plan an outing?”  
- **Constraints matter most:** “Budget, time window, distance, weather, crowds, ‘IG-worthy’, accessibility?”  
- **Decision rules:** “When you finally pick a place, what tipped the decision? (friend consensus, vibe/mood fit, photos, reviews, time/cost)”  
- **Information trust:** “Which sources do you trust most and why? Which do you ignore?”  
- **Group dynamics:** “How do you and friends resolve disagreements on where to go? What slows it down?”  
- **Route/time expectations:** “For a half-day or one-day plan, what’s a ‘good enough’ plan? How precise do timing and routing need to be?”  
- **Location & privacy:** “In what cases would you allow location access? What feels too invasive? How should an app communicate this?”  
- **Value & willingness to pay:**  
  - “If something could cut your deciding/planning time by half and fit your budget/mood better, would that be valuable?  
  What would make it definitely worth it to you?”  
  - “Do you prefer pay-per-trip (tens of baht) or monthly? What benefit must it include to feel fair?”  

## 6) Wrapping Up (1 min)
- “If you had a magic wand to fix one part of deciding/ planning, what would you change?”  
- “Thanks! This was super helpful. May I follow up if I have quick clarifying questions or to show a rough concept later?” (yes/no)  
- “Is there anyone else (friends/classmates) who also struggles with this that you could introduce me to?”  
- **Optional artifact ask:** “If you’re comfortable, could you share screenshots or a short screen recording of how you usually search/plan (IG saves, Maps lists, notes)? It helps me understand real workflows.”
