# Ideal Customer Profile (ICP): Thai University Students in Bangkok

## Demographics & Key Attributes
- **Age / Life stage:** 18–24, undergraduate students (ปี 1–4), mostly living/studying in Bangkok or nearby.
- **Location scope:** Bangkok first; occasional short trips to nearby provinces (Ayutthaya, Pattaya, Kanchanaburi). (Assumption)
- **Language:** Thai-first; basic English OK for tourism terms.
- **Tech & devices:** Heavy mobile usage; mixed Android/iOS but early adopters skew to iPhone. Instagram/TikTok/YouTube for inspiration; LINE for coordination.
- **Budget & spend:** Student budget; typical outing/weekend spend ~฿500–฿3,000 depending on distance/activities. (Assumption)
- **Trip style & cadence:** Short, spontaneous, 0.5–2 days; evenings/weekends, long weekends, post-exam bursts. Often with friends or partners; some solo.
- **Transport:** BTS/MRT, Grab/taxi, motorbike; occasional intercity van/train. Traffic and heat matter.
- **Behavioral traits:** FOMO, trend-seeking, “IG-worthy” bias; low patience for research; prefers quick, visual discovery. Freemium-friendly, ad-tolerant if not intrusive.
- **Payments:** Mobile banking/PromptPay; comfortable with in-app purchases if value is clear.
- **Privacy posture:** Will share location if clear benefit + battery impact is low; wants easy opt-in/opt-out. (Assumption)

## Goals (What they want)

### Primary goals
- Decide quickly where to go (now/this weekend) without scrolling 10 sites.
- Find places that fit mood & constraints (budget, time window, distance, weather).
- Build a simple plan/route with realistic timing and opening hours.
- Coordinate easily with friends/partner (agree on a plan without chaos).

### Secondary goals
- Discover new/hidden gems beyond mainstream lists.
- Capture & remember the outing (photos, timeline) with minimal effort.
- Get student-friendly deals or suggested low-cost options.
- Avoid crowds/traffic/weather gotchas.

## Frustrations / Pains (What blocks them)
- **Decision paralysis:** Too many options, not personalized; “I don’t know where to go.”
- **Fragmented info:** Must switch between IG/TikTok/Blogs/Maps/Reviews; inconsistent, outdated hours.
- **Low trust / spam:** Over-hyped influencer lists; hard to judge quality-to-budget fit.
- **Time & logistics:** Traffic uncertainty, poor route sequencing, last-minute planning stress.
- **Budget anxiety:** Don’t know total cost/time commitment up front.
- **Group friction:** Endless back-and-forth; hard to converge on a place everyone likes.
- **App fatigue:** Long sign-ups, cluttered UI, battery drain from constant GPS.
- **Privacy concerns:** Continuous background tracking without clear value.

## Early-Adopter Signals (useful for recruiting interviewees)
- Active in campus travel/photography/outing groups.
- Posts “where should we go?” on stories; saves travel reels.
- Plans mini-trips after exams/long weekends; likes trying new cafés/rooftops/parks.

## Riskiest Assumptions to Validate Fast
- Students feel the indecision pain often enough to try a new app (frequency & intensity).
- Willingness to allow location (even “While Using”) if it improves relevance.
- Pay intent for premium (what features, at what price point).
- Preferred radius (in-city vs. near-province) and typical budget bands.
